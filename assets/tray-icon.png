// This is a placeholder for the tray icon
// In a real implementation, you would need to create a proper PNG icon file
// For now, we're just creating this file as a placeholder

// Create a new file at project/assets/tray-icon.png
// This should be a 16x16 or 32x32 PNG file with transparency
// For now, you can use a simple placeholder icon or copy an existing icon file
